 EDA
1.  Data Inspection
The dataset was loaded and an initial inspection was done using `df.info()` and `df.head()` to check the data structure, column types, and missing values.

2. Descriptive Statistics
We calculated basic statistical information about the numerical columns (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) to understand their distributions.

3. Correlation Analysis
We created a correlation matrix to observe relationships between numerical variables, especially focusing on churn-related columns.

4. Visualizations
We used histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of key variables and how they relate to churn:

Distribution of Tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges

5. Missing Values
We checked for missing values and handled any missing data found.
